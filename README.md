# U.S. Gun Laws & Gun Deaths

Hello! That you for viewing my project - "U.S. Gun Laws & Gun Deaths."  The goal of this project was to explore the relationship (if any) between gun laws and gun deaths in the United States.  Furthermore, the project uses the synthetic control model to analyze the effect of Oregon's background check laws that were implemented in 2000.  Unfornately, mass shootings have become more and more common in the United States, and as a result, policy dicussions arise that try to ascertain the best course of action.  Finding solutions to reduce gun violence in the U.S. is important because it has real world implications and lives are on the line.

The data for this project comes from a variety of sources, which will be outlined in a citations section at the end of this project. However, all of the data came from publicly available datasets and the majority of the data came from places like the Center for Disease control, Census Bureau, FBI, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

The analysis can be broken up into two sections:

1) Exploratory Data Analysis
2) Contructing the Synthetic Control

### Section 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

What has been the relationship between gun laws and gun deaths over the past decade and a half? Which states have the highest crude firearm death rate? Which states are the most/least strict when it comes to gun laws? These are the questions this section will attempt to answer.  Here, we will consider the period from 1999-2016 to do our initial analysis.

It is important to note that this data, which comes from the CDC, uses the "Crude Death Rate" as a measure of gun deaths in the United States.  This rate is standardized for each state since it is per 100,000 people. Here is a sample of the dataframe below:

![Initialdf](https://github.com/TCummings03/SyntheticControl/blob/master/Synthetic_Control_Files/initialdf_head.png)

By calling the .describe() pandas method on our dataframe, we can learn a few things about the data:

- The average gun death rate in the U.S. from 1999 - 2016 was 11.46, and the median death rate was 11.2
- The min and max cases, 2.2 and 34.0 respectively, are states with either relatively high death rates or relatively low death rates
- The standard deviation was 4.43 over time time period, which means that 95% of the data lies between a gun death rate of 2.6 and 20.29

Which states have the highest and lowest crude death rate?

The graph above gives us a general outline of where different states (and the District of Columbia) stand on gun death rates. The average gun death rate for all states during this time period is 11.46, as mentioned above. At the higher end of the spectrum, DC's Death rate looks to be over 5x higher than Hawaii. Another interesting aspect to note, the New England states appear to be lower on the chart whereas the Southern States appear to be either in the middle or higher on the chart.  Let's explore the number of gun laws and Gun deaths over this same time period.

![StrictBarChart](https://github.com/TCummings03/SyntheticControl/blob/master/Synthetic_Control_Files/StrictBarChart.png)

The plot above seems to have some similarities with the death rate plot presented earlier, where the least strict states appear to be in the south and midwest and the most strict states appear to be in the New England area.

One of the most important thing to note about the plot above is that there are two different y axis. The left axis maps the total number of gun laws in the U.S. while the right axis maps the crude death rate in the U.S. (per 100,000 people).  Also included in the plot is the expiration date for the federal assault weapons ban, which ended in 2004 after 10 years. However, the year after the assault weapons ban, there is a rise in the gun death rate that levels off for the next three years. Although we cannot determine causality just by looking at the plot above, we can say that there have been some of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history since the assault weapons ban expired.  Two of these, Virginia Tech and Sandy Hook, are highlighted on the plot above.  What is interesting to notice about these two events is that the subseqeunt years we see a stead increase in the number of gun laws passed with a dramatic increase in gun legislation passed after the shooting at Sandy Hook occured. 

Another interesting note on the relationship between these two figures is that after Sandy hook not only do we see an increase in the number of gun laws passed, but we also see a fairly dramatic increase in the crude death rate in the U.S. as well. Although this project will not touch on those events specifically, they are interesting to note and would benefit from further analysis.
